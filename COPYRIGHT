LICENCE
-------
Definition: "this software" = any software which is distributed under
                              the conditions of this licence.
            "small number of modules" = less than 10% of any one program

It is the intention that this software be "freely available" in the Gnu
(http://www.gnu.org/) and Open Source (http://www.opensource.org/)
traditions.  The following is a brief statement of the rights and
restrictions attached to this software distribution.  This is version
2 of the licence, and governs this copy of the software.  We may
publish modified terms and conditions at a later date, and if you wish,
you may apply any successor licence (when published), or the GNU GPL,
to this software as an alternative to the current terms.  (Note that
if you convert your copy of the licence to the GPL, you will not be
able to convert it back later, and nor can anyone who receives a copy
from you.)

If you are not sure about any of the terms of this licence, please
contact us to discuss your requirements.  (Primary contact:
Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk)

You may use, re-distribute, and modify this software, in whole or
in part, in source or binary form, but you must include without
alteration all the relevant copyright notices.  (You may of course
remove a copyright notice pertaining to a piece of software no longer
included in your distribution.)  You may add your own additional
copyright notices for any modifications or additions to this software
that you distribute.  If you distribute a modified version, you must
also provide corresponding source code for it; any modifications must
be described in the documentation; and you must clearly indicate that
the software has been modified, for instance by changing the name of
the executable or its version number, or by some other method.

You must not restrict anyone else's rights to use, re-distribute
or modify any part of this software.  Distributions of standard or
modified versions of any part of this software must retain this licence
(or its successor), or at your choice, be distributed instead under
the GNU GPL.

In addition, you are explicitly granted the right to re-use a small
number of modules of this software in the creation of a new program
which does not perform substantially the same task as this software,
for instance, by re-using a parser but not the entire compiler.
In such a case, you are not forced to place the new software under
this or any other licence, but you must ensure that:
 . you clearly acknowledge which code you have re-used from this software,
 . you retain the relevant copyright notices, and
 . if you distribute the new software, you indicate to recipients where
   they can freely obtain a standard copy of this original software.

Programs, object files, and intermediate files produced as output
by this software do not fall under this copyright statement and are
not governed by the terms of this licence.  You are free to use them
(or restrict their use) as you like.  In particular, the inclusion of
nhc98's runtime system and the Haskell'98 libraries in a resultant
program, solely by virtue of being compiled and linked by nhc98,
does not place any restrictions on your use of your own program.
However, you should check carefully the licence of any other library
you use in your program, whether supplied together with this software
or not.

UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THIS SOFTWARE IS SUPPLIED "AS IS"
AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  NEITHER THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, NOR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO REDISTRIBUTES THIS SOFTWARE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES,
HOWSOEVER CAUSED, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
