ABOUT THE NAME "AElfred"
-----------------------

AElfred the Great (AElfred in ASCII) was king of Wessex, and at least
nominally of all England, at the time of his death in 899AD.  AElfred
introduced a wide-spread literacy program in the hope that his people
would learn to read English, at least, if Latin was too difficult for
them.  This AElfred hopes to bring another sort of literacy to Java,
using XML, at least, if full SGML is too difficult.

The initial "AE" ("Æ" in ISO-8859-1) is also a reminder that XML is
not limited to ASCII.
