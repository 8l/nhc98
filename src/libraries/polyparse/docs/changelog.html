<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.4.1</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for 'discard', so that in the lazy variation it actually checks
    that the item to be discarded satisfies the given parser.
<li>Bugfixes in Text.Parse, such that 'optionalParens' is used more
    consistently.

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.4</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>New API: the primitive parser 'eof' is now available in all variations of
    the Poly combinators.
<li>New implementation of Text.Parse.word - it no longer uses the
    Haskell'98 Prelude.lex, but provides its own proper lexer, with better
    error messages.
<li>New module: Text.ParserCombinators.Poly.ByteString is an instance of
    the PolyParse class specialised to ByteString input, rather than being
    polymorphic over the input token type.
<li>New module: Text.Parse.ByteString, is like Text.Parse but with
    ByteString input rather than String.
<li>New API calls: Text.Parse.readByParse and readsPrecByParsePrec,
    to make it easy to create instances of the old Read class (for
    backwards compatibility) from your TextParser.
<li>Bugfix: in Text.Parse, parseInt, parseDec, parseOct, and parseHex had an
    extra spurious argument that was unused, so it has been removed (API
    change).  In addition parseLitChar relied on the non-existent use of
    that argument, so it has been fixed too.
<li>Bugfix: Text.Parse.parseFloat now accepts a plain integer as a float,
    to match the H'98 behaviour of readFloat.
<li>Bugfix: the `discard` combinator now forces the discarded item;
    previously incorrect parses could hide inside, without triggering an error.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.3</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix: Text.Parse.parseFloat now accepts ordinary floating point
    notation, in addition to scientific (exponent) notation.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.2</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Improves the Text.Parse implementation significantly.  Where
    previously all the parsers for builtin basic datatype (Int,Float,Char)
    were just thin wrappers over the H'98 Read instances, now they are all
    proper parsers, therefore they should (a) be faster; (b) give better
    error messages.
<li>Reduced the number of implementation variations to choose from.
    In particular, NoLeak has become the default implementation, and
    the previous default has been dropped (because it space-leaks).
<!--
<li>[desired] The class interface providing common operations across all
    implementations, now need be no slower than the previous
    cut-n-pasted interface, due to compiler specialisation of all the
    instances.
<li>[desired] New combinators for parsing infix structures, with
    associativity and precedence information.
<li>[desired] Multiple layers of bracketing can be parsed in linear time,
    rather than the previous exponential solution.
-->
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.1</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Much improved the laziness of the PolyLazy combinators.
<li>Addition of a class-based interface to the Poly libraries, to
    reduce code duplication amongst the variations, and to allow for
    more experimentation with different implementations.
<li>Several new experimental implementations of the interface.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.0</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Version number change from 1.00 to 1.0, for silly cabal/hackage.
<li>Minor fix to parsing strings in Text.Parse.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in polyparse-1.00</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>No changes, but released separately from HaXml
</ul>

<h3>Changes in HaXml-1.16</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> New: lazier parsers
     <ul>
     <li> <tt>Text.XML.HaXml.ParseLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.XML.HaXml.Html.ParseLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyLazy</tt>
     <li> <tt>Text.ParserCombinators.PolyStateLazy</tt>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in HaXml-1.15</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> New: DrIFT has now been fully updated to
     produce instances of Text.ParserCombinators.TextParser.Parse.
<li> New: the parser combinator library Poly has been split into two
     variations, Poly and PolyState.  They have almost the same API,
     only the latter includes a running state where the former does not.
<li> The TextParser library (a replacement for the Haskell'98 Read class)
     has also been improved with more new combinators.  Really, these
     parser combinator experiments do not belong in HaXml, and will
     eventually be split out into a separate package.
</ul>
