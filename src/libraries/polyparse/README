    polyparse - a collection of alternative parser combinator libraries
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions:
We currently support nhc98, ghc, and Hugs.  The automatic configuration
detects which compilers/interpreters you have, and prepares a build
tree for each.  Installation may require write-permission on the system
directories of the compiler/interpreter.  The libraries and interfaces
can then be used as "-package polyparse" (for ghc/nhc98 - no extra options
required for Hugs).

    sh configure
    make
    make install

Options to configure are:
    --buildwith=...  e.g. ghc-6.6,        to build for a specific compiler
    --prefix=...     e.g. /usr/local,     to change installation location

Complaints to:  :-)

P.S.
    For those building on Windows /without/ Cygwin, you can avoid the need
    for configure/make steps by simply running the minimal build script in
        Build.bat
    You will need to edit it for the location of your compiler etc.
