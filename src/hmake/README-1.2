This file describe how to build nhcmake version 0.04. Read the file Summary for an
explanation of what nhcmake is.

Unix:
 Compile NhcMk and Older, preferably with hbcmake NhcMk Older. It's
also possible to use nhcmake but a nhc compiled version is slower than
if nhcmake is compiled with hbc. If neither nhcmake nor hbcmake is
availible then run the shell script BuildNew.
 Place NhcMk and Older in the nhc library and change the
shell script nhcmake accordingly.
 BuildNew, nhcmakeR, older.c and exfile.c are not used under Unix.


RISC OS:
 Compile NhcMk, exfile and older, the later two are C-programs (located
in cfiles/, older needs RISC_OSlib).
If you don't have an earlier version of nhcmake use BuildNewRC, if you have the
necessary c-files. BuildNewR uses the Haskell files a source.
Both BuildNewRC and BuildNewR are Obey files.
 Place NhcMk in the nhc library and change the obey file nhcmakeR
accordingly.  Put exfile, older and nhcmakeR in your binary
directory. Nhcmake will create the files nhcmk_via and __nhcmake in
<Wimp$ScrapDir> when used.
 I'm sorry for all the garbage produced on the screen when compiling but
that's the way Command files work.
 BuildNew, nhcmake and Older.hs are not used under RISC OS.
