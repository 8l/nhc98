This file describe how to build nhc13make version 0.05 for Haskell 1.3.
See the file "README" for instructions for the older Haskell 1.2, and the
file "Summary" for an explanation of what nhcmake is.

Unix:
 *  Change the shell script nhc13make according to your preferred
    installation directories.
 *  Compile NhcMk and Older, preferably with hbcmake NhcMk Older. It is
    not yet possible to use nhc13make, because the all-important FileStat
    library does not yet exist in nhc13.  If hbcmake is not available then
    run the shell script BuildNew (you will need hbc), or use ordinary
    `make install'.
 *  Place NhcMk and Older in the nhc library (already done for you if you used
    `make install')
 *  BuildNewR, nhcmakeR, older.c and exfile.c are not used under Unix.


RISC OS:
 (completely untested on Haskell 1.3)
 *  Compile NhcMk, exfile and older, the later two are C-programs (located
    in cfiles/, older needs RISC_OSlib).
    If you don't have an earlier version of nhcmake use BuildNewRC, if
    you have the necessary c-files. BuildNewR uses the Haskell files a source.
    Both BuildNewRC and BuildNewR are Obey files.
 *  Place NhcMk in the nhc library and change the obey file nhcmakeR
    accordingly.  Put exfile, older and nhcmakeR in your binary
    directory. Nhcmake will create the files nhcmk_via and __nhcmake in
    <Wimp$ScrapDir> when used.
 *  I'm sorry for all the garbage produced on the screen when compiling but
    that's the way Command files work.
 *  BuildNew, nhcmake and Older.hs are not used under RISC OS.
