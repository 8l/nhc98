This file describes how to build hmake version 0.2.0 for Haskell 1.3.
The other files "README-1.[23]" give instructions for older versions of
this tool.

Unix:
 *  Change the shell script hmake according to your preferred
    installation directories.
 *  Compile NhcMk and Older, preferably with `make all'. It is
    now possible to compile using either nhc13 or hbc.
 *  Place NhcMk and Older in the nhc13 library (done for you if you use
    `make install').
