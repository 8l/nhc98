This directory contains 'cpphs', a simplified but robust
re-implementation of cpp, the C pre-processor, in Haskell.

TO BUILD
--------
Just use
    hmake cpphs [-package base]
or
    ghc --make cpphs [-o cpphs]		#  -o needed for ghc <= 6.4.1 ]
or
    runhugs cpphs	# or rename the script cpphs.hugs to cpphs


USAGE
-----
	cpphs  [filename | -Dsym | -Dsym=val | -Ipath]+  [-Ofile]
               [ --include=file ]*
               [ --nomacro | --noline | --nowarn | --strip | --strip-eol |
                 --pragma | --text | --hashes | --layout | --unlit |
                 --linepragma ]*
               [ --cpp compatopts ]

For fuller details, see docs/index.html

If you want to use cpphs as a completely drop-in replacement for the
real cpp, that is, to accept the same arguments, and have broadly
the same behaviour in response to them, then use the --cpp compatibility
option.
