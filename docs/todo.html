<hr>

<p>
This is more of a wishlist than a ToDo list, but anyway...
our hopes for the future of <b>nhc98</b> include the following.
<a href="contrib.html">Contributions</a> of libraries, interesting 
optimisations, bugfixes, and so on, are always welcome.

<ul>
<li>The <em>Fudgets</em> GUI library was once available for nhc13:
    now that nhc98 has existential types, Fudgets could now be supported
    once again.  Volunteers for this would need to know the internals
    of Fudgets pretty thoroughly.

<li>The implementation of <em>GreenCard</em> could be completed.
    Remaining unimplemented features include named field syntax
    and failure specifications.  In addition, the new primitive FFI
    still lacks <em>dynamic</em> imports and exports, which are
    fairly essential for callback-style GUI programming.

<li>It would be very useful to have a set of simple regression tests
    (with an automated interface) to check whether anything breaks on
    a new machine architecture, or after modifying a part of the compiler.
    (We have a set of tests for the binary libraries, and they have
    definitely proved their worth!)  Haskell also needs a set of
    conformance tests, to determine whether any particular implementation
    meets the Haskell'98 standard, and if not, where it differs.

<li><em>nhc98</em> would be an ideal basis for a cross-compiler, since
    it uses standard ANSI C as a backend.  (Note: It might be important to
    pass the word-size of the target machine into the compiler
    at compile-time.  It is currently hard-coded in.)

<li>We would like to replace the current textual format of interface
    files with a binary format.  (We conjecture a big speed gain during
    compilation.) One difficulty is that nhc98 is often built with hbc,
    which does not yet support Binary.  However, it would be of even
    greater interest to obtain a speed gain when using an nhc98 built
    with nhc98!

</ul>
