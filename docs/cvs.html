  <h1>CVS access to nhc98</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<p>
This page tells you how to get CVS access to the latest, most current,
<em>nhc98</em> sources.

<p>
Note that we only store non-regenerable files in CVS, so if you don't
already have a working Haskell compiler, you won't be able to build
from C sources using CVS.


<h3>Viewing the CVS repository on the web</h3>
<p>
If you don't want to download the sources, you can view the current
contents of the anonymous CVS repository on the web
<a href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/nhc98/">here</a>.


<h3>Remote Read-only CVS Access</h3>

<p>
Read-only access is available to anyone - there's no need to ask us
first.  To get read-only access to our repository:

<ul>
<li> Obviously, you need to have the <em>cvs</em> command installed.
<li> The first time you access the repository, you'll need to do
     the following:
<pre>
      $ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@glass.cse.ogi.edu:/cvs login
      Password: cvs
</pre>
     You only need to supply the password once, because cvs will squirrel
     it away for future use in $HOME/.cvspass.

<li> To checkout the nhc98 compiler sources, use this command:
<pre>
      $ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@glass.cse.ogi.edu:/cvs checkout nhc98
</pre>
     The checked-out source tree will appear in a directory called
     <tt>nhc98</tt>.  You can rename this directory to whatever you
     like, CVS won't mind.
<li> From then on, you should no longer need the <em>-d blah</em> option,
     and commands like
<pre>
      $ cvs diff
      $ cvs update
</pre>
     should work, provided your working directory is somewhere inside
     the checked out tree.  In normal use, <tt>cvs update</tt>
     is the command to merge the latest changes from the central
     repository into your local tree.  <tt>cvs diff</tt> gives you
     the differences between your version and the central version.
<li> If you change your current directory into a sub-directory of the
     CVS tree, cvs commands will normally operate only on that subtree,
     not on the full tree.  This is very handy if you are only interested
     in a small part of the source.
</ul>

<p>
With read-only CVS access you can do anything except commit changes
to the repository. You can make changes to your local tree, and still
use CVS's update facility to keep your tree otherwise up-to-date,
and you can generate patches using <tt>cvs diff</tt> in order to send
to us for inclusion.

<p>
To set up default flags for some of the CVS commands, you can create
a <tt>.cvsrc</tt> file.  For instance, the -P flag to 'update' says
prune empty directories, which is normally what you want, and the -d
flag ensures that you collect new directories that have been added.
Here is an example <tt>.cvsrc</tt> file:
<pre>
        checkout -P
        release -d
        update -d -P
        diff -c
</pre>

<h3>Using the checked-out CVS tree</h3>

<p>
The first thing to do after checking out a fresh tree is
<tt>./configure</tt>, setting whatever options you wish to use.
It is always safe to re-run the <tt>./configure</tt> script at any
time - it will never leave your configuration in an inconsistent state.
The machine/OS combination is always detected first so you can't re-use
the wrong machine configuration by mistake, and although previous
options for a particular machine are cached, they are always reported,
and can be always overridden on the command line.

<p>
Then, do a <tt>make</tt> with whatever targets you are interested
in: <tt>make help</tt> will give you a list of the common ones.
For instance, <tt>make basic</tt> gives you the standard compiler, and
<tt>make all</tt> gives you profiling and tracing variants in addition.


<h3>Tracking changes in the CVS repository</h3>
<p>
The log messages of all CVS commit actions are sent to the mailing list
<tt>cvs-nhc98@haskell.org</tt>.  If you wish to see who is making
changes, why, and and what they say about them, please do join this
list - see <a href="http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo">
<tt>http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo</tt></a> for further details.


<h3>Core developers - write-access to CVS</h3>
<p>
Core developers of <em>nhc98</em> have write-access to the CVS
repository.  They need to use a slightly different procedure for
accessing the source tree:

<ul>
<li> You need to have <em>ssh</em> (secure shell) installed.
<li> Set your CVS_RSH environment variable to <tt>ssh</tt>.
<li> The first time you access the repository, you'll need to do
     the following:
<pre>
      $ cvs -d :ext:<em>username</em>@cvs.haskell.org:/home/cvs/root checkout nhc98
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
All the other instructions are the same, except that developers also
have permission to commit changes to the repository.

<h3>Gaining write-access</h3>
<p>
To obtain write-access to cvs.haskell.org, you need to ask the
Haskell CVS maintainer - Jeff Lewis &lt;jlewis@galconn.com&gt; - for
an account.  The details are on the
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html">
GHC CVS cheat-sheet</a> (Section 2.1.2).
