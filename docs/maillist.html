<h3>List information</h3>
<p>
There are three mailing lists available for all users of the nhc98
Haskell compiler, (including ordinary users, implementors, and
researchers) to share information, discuss features, report bugs,
distribute patches, plan future directions, and so on.  They are:

<p>
<table><tr>
<td>For discussions and announcements:</td>
<td><a href="http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/nhc-users">
    <b>nhc-users@haskell.org</b></a></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>For bug reports and fixes:</td>
<td><a href="http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/nhc-bugs">
    <b>nhc-bugs@haskell.org</b></a></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>For developers using the darcs repository:</td>
<td><a href="http://haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cvs-nhc98">
    <b>cvs-nhc98@haskell.org</b></a></td>
</tr></table>


<p>
Minor releases of the compiler will be announced on the
<b>nhc-users</b> list.  Major releases will also be announced more
widely, for instance on the Haskell mailing list.

<p>
We encourage users to submit all bug reports to the <b>nhc-bugs</b>
list, rather than directly to the maintainers, to ensure that both the
bugs and their fixes are publically accessible via the list archive.

<p>
The list <b>cvs-nhc98</b> is mainly for `commit' messages to the CVS/darcs
repository.  However, if you have a bug report that only applies to
a recent CVS/darcs version, this might be a more appropriate list to report
it than on the more general bugs list.

<p>
Note: due to the huge volume of spam that gets sent to the list
addresses (but caught by filters) you <em>must</em> now be a member of a
list, in order to post to it.  All non-member postings will be rejected
automatically.



<h3>To subscribe or unsubscribe</h3>
<p>
To join a list, to leave it, or to modify your personal settings,
just go to the appropriate web page for the list and follow the
instructions.

<h3>List archive</h3>
<p>
A web archive of messages is available for each list from its homepage
(listed above).  You do not need to be a member of a list to search
its archive.  One list, nhc-users, was run from a different server
prior to 1st May 2001.  Messages from before that date are archived
separately at:
