<hr>
<h3>The Brief Version</h3>
<p>
If you are in a hurry to get started, here's the brief version of the
install procedure:
<pre>
    $ ./configure  [ --prefix=/usr/local ]
    $ make [ all ]
    [ perhaps become root ]
    $ make install
</pre>

<h3>Upgrading from an earlier version</h3>
<p>
If you already have an older version of <i>nhc98</i> installed, you do
not need to do anything special when upgrading to a newer version - the
newer will overwrite the older.

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>
Currently, nhc98 assumes a 32-bit processor, or a 32-bit emulation mode
on a 64-bit processor.  Basically, if your C compiler accepts the -m32
flag, then you will be OK.  (If it doesn't, you will see build errors
pretty immediately!)

<p>
Users of Windows 95/98/SE/Me/NT/2k/XP/Vista/7/etc, please see these
<a href="windows.html">special Windows instructions</a> first.

<p>
For the binary release, we assume you have a good C compiler (usually
<em>gcc</em>), and a <em>sh</em> compatible with the Bourne shell.

<p>
If you want to use the graphical debugging tool <em>hood</em>, you
will need to have Java on your PATH.

<p>
For the source release, you need the usual C compilation management
tools (<em>gcc</em>, <em>ar</em>, GNU <em>make</em>, etc.).  To build
<em>nhc98</em> without another Haskell compiler, you need at least
16Mb of memory, and about 150Mb of disk space (300Mb if you build for
all forms of profiling as well).  If you already have another Haskell
compiler, <em>ghc-6.6</em> or later (ensure you have the filepath
package), then building <em>nhc98</em> will require at least 64Mb of
memory, and 300Mb of free disk space.  If you don't have
<em>ghc</em> for your machine, then don't worry, <em>nhc98</em> will
build quite happily using just a C compiler.  (The basic build is much
faster, but the resulting compiler will be slower.)  You can also build
<em>nhc98</em> using an earlier version of <em>nhc98</em> if you want,
but we don't do that by default because the build time can be slow.

<h3>Download it</h3>
<p>
You have the option of building <em>nhc98</em> from a source tree, or
installing a binary-only distribution.  You only need to collect the
single package you require.

<p>
The current distribution packages can be found at
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/nhc98/download.html">http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/nhc98/download.html</a>
</pre>
Using <em>tar</em> and <em>gunzip</em>, unpack your chosen package, and
<em>cd</em> to the base directory (called nhc98-x.xx, where the x's are the
version number).  Note that all the documentation available on the web
is also included in all packages, although the web versions will of course
be more up-to-date.  Your local copy of the release notes is
in <a href="status.html">docs/status.html</a>.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
An automatic configuration utility is supplied, called
<em>configure</em>.  In brief, the default behaviour is to build under
<em>targets</em> in the current directory, and to install various
components under <em>/usr/local</em>, in the subdirectories
<em>bin</em>, <em>lib/nhc98</em>, <em>include/nhc98</em>, and
<em>man/man1</em>.  The config script has several useful options to
override the default build and installation behaviours.  Use the
<em>--help</em> option for brief details, and see the page about
<a href=config.html>configuration options</a> for full details.

<p>
<b>Important:</b> The config script searches your system for other
Haskell compilers.  If it guesses wrongly, you can edit the file
<em>script/hmake.config</em> to fix things up, then re-run
<em>configure</em>.  Your changes will not be undone.

<h3>Installing from a binary distribution</h3>
<p>
Simply run
<pre>
    ./configure
    make install
</pre>
to install <em>nhc98</em>.  The default location is under
<em>/usr/local</em>, but you may alter the installation location using
either of the <em>--prefix=</em> or <em>--installdir=</em> options
to <em>configure</em>.  There are various other
<a href=config.html>configuration options</a> also.



<h3>Building and installing from sources</h3>
<p>
All object files are created in a separate directory tree from
the sources.  This means it is possible to build concurrently for
different machines from the same shared source tree.  You can also
build the heap profiling and time profiling versions of the prelude
and runtime system concurrently if you wish.

<p>
The current distribution of the compiler will build for any machine
with 32-bit words.  (Sorry, no 64-bit support yet.)  All questions of
machine endian-ness are handled automatically during configuration.
If you are not using <em>gcc</em> as your C compiler, please ensure
that your <em>CC</em> environment variable is set appropriately at
the configuration stage.  (The C compiler is used as a portable
backend for nhc98, and is always required.)  For instance,
<pre>    CC=cc   ./configure --buildwith=...</pre>

<p>
Run <em>./configure</em> with any <a href=config.html>options</a> you
require.  (You should supply installation directory options at this
stage.)  This will attempt to detect any existing Haskell compilers and
guess which one to build <em>nhc98</em> with.  If you have more than one
available, we will choose, in order of preference, <em>ghc</em>, then
<em>hbc</em>.  If neither of these is found, <em>nhc98</em> will be
built from the bootstrapping C sources included in the package.  (You
can build <em>nhc98</em> using an earlier version of <em>nhc98</em> if
you want using the configure options, but it is not selected by default.)

<p>
Decide what profiling features you want to use -
<em>make help</em> gives a list of useful individual targets,
such as <em>basic</em>, <em>heapprofile</em>, and <em>timeprofile</em>.

<p>
Then run <em>make</em> with your chosen targets, or <em>make all</em>
to build all the possible facilities.  (A simple <em>make</em>
without targets builds everything.)

<p>
The time taken to build nhc98 depends on your machine, operating
system, which compiler you are using, and whether you have asked for
just the basic libraries or extra profiling libraries.  Here are some
sample build times:

<p>
Finally, when you have built all the components you require, type
<em>make install</em> to copy the components to their final location.
(You may need to become root for this step, depending on the final
location you selected at configure time.)  As an alternative to
installing in a system-wide location, it is also possible to use all
the <em>nhc98</em> tools in-place in the build tree by adding the
<em>script</em> directory to your PATH - if you wish to conserve disk
space by removing temporary intermediate files from the build tree,
use <em>make clean</em>.

<h4>Cross-compiling</h4>

<p>Nhc98 can now be built to work as a cross-compiler, using an
already present toolchain as backend, that will be remembered by
binaries and scripts after installation.
</p>

<p>If you ever change your tool chain, you may edit the bin/nhc98
script, whereas you may be better off rebuilding everything.</p>

<p>The cross-compiler mode is activated by the <b>--target</b> flag who
takes the name of the target architecture as parameter. This
argument is actually free, but you should follow the established
convention: naming after the processor-OS-vendor. A good bet is to
use whatever prefix your cross-compiler has.</p>

<p>Some other options are mandatory when the target flag is set. Run <b>./configure --help</b>
to know which.</p>

<p>A typical invocation would look like:</p> 

<p> <code>$CC=/usr/local/uclibc-0.9.28-3/arm/bin/arm-linux-gcc 
STRIP=/usr/local/uclibc-0.9.28-3/arm/bin/arm-linux-strip 
./configure --target=arm-linux --endian=-DLOW_BYTE_FIRST 
--ccoption="-O3" --ldoption="" 
--cabal-parse=/home/sylvain/bin/nhc98/lib/nhc98/ix86-Linux/cabal-parse 
--hostcc=gcc --hoststrip=strip --prefix=/home/sylvain/bin/nhc98-arm-linux 
--installdir=/home/sylvain/bin/nhc98-arm-linux
</code> </p>

<p> <code>$make</code> </p>
<p> <code>$make install</code> </p>

<h3>Problems?</h3>
<p>
Ok, so now you should have all the components of a working compiler.
If you have any problems, mail <a href="mailto:nhc-bugs@haskell.org">
<tt>nhc-bugs@haskell.org</tt></a> with a description (and a
bugfix if you have one!).

<h4>Common gotchas</h4>
<ul>
<li> You cannot build nhc98 from a directory with spaces in it.
<li> If you bootstrap from C sources, and the build segfaults, check
     the output of '<tt>ulimit -s</tt>'.  If the user process
     stacksize is set to 8192 or less, this is the cause.  Increase it,
     either with '<tt>ulimit -s unlimited</tt>', or if that fails,
     '<tt>ulimit -s hard</tt>'.
</ul>

<h3>Can you help us?</h3>
<p>
If you have built <em>nhc98</em> for a machine not currently listed on the
<a href=download.html>download page</a> and would like to contribute
it as a binary package for others to download, it is very easy to do.
After building and installing, type `<em>make binDist</em>' <u>before</u>
you tidy up with `<em>make clean</em>'.  Then upload the resulting tarfile
to somewhere we can access it, send an email to let us know about it, and
we will copy it to our central download site.

<h3>Keeping up-to-date</h3>
<p>
If you use <em>nhc98</em> regularly, please join the <a href="maillist.html">
nhc-users</a> mailing list for discussion of features, bugfixes, and so on.
