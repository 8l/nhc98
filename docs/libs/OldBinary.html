This document describes the York Binary library.  (See also the
<a href="BinArray.html">BinArray</a> library for an example of the
use of Binary to build other abstractions.)

<h3>The York Binary library</h3>
<pre>
    module Binary where

    data BinPtr a = ...
    data BinLocation = Memory | File FilePath BinIOMode
    data BinIOMode = RO | RW | WO
    data BinHandle = ...

    stdmem     :: BinHandle
    openBin    :: BinLocation -&gt; IO BinHandle
    freezeBin  :: BinHandle -&gt; IO ()	-- changes BinIOMode to RO
    closeBin   :: BinHandle -&gt; IO ()
    copyBin    :: BinHandle -&gt; BinLocation -&gt; IO BinHandle

    isEOFBin   :: BinHandle -&gt; IO Bool
    seekBin    :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; IO ()
    tellBin    :: BinHandle -&gt; IO (BinPtr a)

    class Binary a where
        put    :: BinHandle -&gt; a -&gt; IO (BinPtr a)
        get    :: BinHandle -&gt; IO a
        putAt  :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; a -&gt; IO ()
        getAt  :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; IO a
        getFAt :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; a

<h3>Programming model</h3>
<p>
Both in-heap data compression and binary I/O can be achieved using the
York <tt>Binary</tt> library.  The basic model is rather like file
I/O:  binary data resides in a separate space which is accessed only
through a <tt>BinHandle</tt> acting like a buffering file descriptor.
Each item of binary data lies at a particular position within the
space, the position being denoted by a <tt>BinPtr</tt>.  Data can be
written and read sequentially just as with ordinary files.  Also, like
ordinary files, we allow random-access reading and writing.  However,
the particular beauty of this scheme is the ability to engage in
<em>pure, lazy,</em> random-access reading when a <tt>BinHandle</tt> is
in the appropriate <tt>RO</tt> (read-only) mode.  (A <tt>BinHandle</tt>
which is already open for writing can be changed to <tt>RO</tt> mode
with the <tt>freezeBin</tt> call.)

<p>
<tt>BinHandle</tt>s do not just denote files - they can also refer to
areas of heap memory.  One such area is available by default - called
<tt>stdmem</tt> - but new areas can be opened in just the
same way as files.  They are opened in the default mode <tt>RW</tt>.
Binary heap areas grow automatically to fit the data placed in them, and,
like files, they are naturally garbage-collected when they are no longer
in use.  (The <tt>closeBin</tt> operation is an explicit means to close
a file or discard some memory.)

<p>
The <tt>Binary</tt> class is derivable for any datatype defined in a
program except functions.  (Please note however that cyclic or infinite
values will cause the compressing function to diverge.)

<p>
The class member functions come in two varieties, one for sequential
access, the other for random access.  A <tt>BinHandle</tt> contains a
hidden state, including the <em>current position</em> in the file or
memory.  Understanding the notion of the current position is important
for using the sequential operations correctly.  <tt>put</tt> and
<tt>get</tt> always start reading or writing from the current position.
All operations <em>including the random-access ones</em>, when they
return, set the current position to the end of the value which has
just been read or written.

<table><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>put :: BinHandle -&gt; a -&gt; IO (BinPtr a)</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>put bh x</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>writes a binary representation of the ordinary value
      <tt>x</tt> sequentially at the current position, returning a pointer
      to the beginning of the value.
      Where later sequential reading is sufficient, the return value of
      <tt>put</tt> can be discarded.  When random-access is required, the
      return value of <tt>put</tt> can be used as the positional argument of
      <tt>getAt</tt> and <tt>putAt</tt>.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>get :: BinHandle -&gt; IO a</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>get bh</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>reads a binary representation sequentially from the current
      position, returning the ordinary representation of the value.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>putAt :: BinHandle -&gt; a -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; IO ()</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>putAt bh p x</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>writes a binary representation of the ordinary value
      <tt>x</tt> at the position <tt>p</tt>, returning nothing.  The pointer
      <tt>p</tt> might have been obtained as the result of an earlier
      <tt>put</tt> operation, or it may been read from a binary stream via
      a <tt>get</tt> operation, or indeed it may have been calculated.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>getAt :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; IO a</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>getAt bh p</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>reads a binary representation from the position <tt>p</tt>, 
      returning the ordinary representation of the value.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td colspan=2><tt>getFAt :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; a</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td width=200 valign=top><tt>getFAt bh p</tt></td>
  <td valign=top>is a pure, lazy, version of the <tt>getAt</tt> method, which
      can only be used on "frozen" <tt>BinHandle</tt>s.</td>

<h3>Transferring bits in bulk</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to transfer bits in bulk is with the <tt>copyBin</tt>
operation.  It takes an active <tt>BinHandle</tt> and copies its entire
contents into the given <tt>BinLocation</tt>, returning a fresh
<tt>BinHandle</tt> denoting the copy.

<p>
A completely different method exists to transfer individual binary
values in bulk.  By recording the size of each binary value explicitly
(which costs a certain amount of space), we can transfer just the
bits belonging to that value, rather than the entire <tt>BinHandle</tt>.
(This method predates the introduction of <tt>BinHandle</tt>s, so it
may turn out to be less space-efficient, less quick, and more complex than
the newer <tt>copyBin</tt> method.  Tell us which method you prefer.)

<p>
There are "sized" variations of two of the binary operations:
<pre>
    data SizedBin a = SB Size BinHandle (BinPtr a)

    sizedPut    :: Binary a =&gt; BinHandle  -&gt; a -&gt; IO (SizedBin a)
    sizedGetFAt :: Binary a =&gt; SizedBin a -&gt; a
</pre>
The main purpose of the sized operations is to enable efficient bulk
transfer of binary data between two <tt>BinHandle</tt>s (typically
between memory and file, although it can equally well occur between 
two files or two memory spaces).  The sized operations do not implement
this bulk transfer themselves - however bulk transfer is efficient
only when the amount of data is known beforehand.

<p>
Hence there is a standard instance of class <tt>Binary</tt> for the type
<tt>SizedBin a</tt>:  the operations <tt>put</tt> and <tt>get</tt>, when
used on sized binary values, effect the bulk transfer of bits from one
<tt>BinHandle</tt> to another.  It should be noted that <tt>get</tt>ting
a sized binary value automatically allocates a fresh <tt>BinHandle</tt>
in memory, since there is no other way of specifying a destination for a
transfer in this direction.  This fresh <tt>BinHandle</tt> (enclosed
anonymously within the <tt>SizedBin a</tt> value) is also
frozen into <tt>RO</tt> mode after the transfer, ready for a later
<tt>sizedGetFAt</tt> operation.

<h3>Defining your own compression</h3>
<p>
If you want to play with defining your own instances of <tt>Binary</tt>, have
a look at some of the instances for standard types like Int and Lists
in <tt>src/prelude/Binary/Instances.hs</tt> to see how things work.
One need define only three of the member functions - the others are
defined in terms of them.

<p>
The lower-level tools used in defining instances are:
<pre>
    class Binary a where
        ...
        unsafeGetAt  :: BinHandle -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; (a,BinPtr b)

    getBits :: BinHandle -&gt; Int -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; IO Int
    putBits :: BinHandle -&gt; Int -&gt; Int      -&gt; IO (BinPtr a)
    getAux  :: BinHandle -&gt; Int -&gt; BinPtr a -&gt; (Int,BinPtr a)
    (&lt;&lt;) :: ((a-&gt;b),c) -&gt; (c-&gt;(a,d)) -&gt; (b,d)
</pre>

<h3>Read and write modes</h3>
<p>
A file <tt>BinHandle</tt> can be opened in one of three modes: read-only
(<tt>RO</tt>), write-only (<tt>WO</tt>), or read-write (<tt>RW</tt>).
A memory <tt>BinHandle</tt> is always opened in <tt>RW</tt> mode, but
may be changed to <tt>RO</tt> mode by the <tt>freezeBin</tt> operation.
These modes differ from those of ordinary textual files:

<dl>
<dt>A binary operation never raises an I/O exception.</dt>
  <dd>When in <tt>RO</tt> mode, the operations <tt>put</tt> and <tt>putAt</tt>
      will not fail, but nor will they alter the file/memory.
  <dd>When in <tt>WO</tt> mode, the operations <tt>get</tt> and <tt>getAt</tt>
      will return odd values, not corresponding to the real file/memory.
  <dd>Encountering EOF in <tt>RO</tt> mode does not raise an error -
      reading beyond the end of the file/memory will simply return zeros.
      However, the operation <tt>isEOFBin</tt> can be used to test the
      condition.
  <dd>The <tt>getFAt</tt> operation <em>will</em> give a runtime error if
      the file/memory is not in <tt>RO</tt> mode, but since this error does
      not arise within the I/O monad. it cannot be trapped.
<dt>In <tt>RW</tt> mode, interleaving read and write operations is safe.</dt>
  <dd>The semantics of <tt>RW</tt> mode is that the file/memory is
      <em>overwritten</em>.  In other words, you can write just a single
      bit in the middle of the file/memory if you want to - everything else
      will stay the same.  In particular, unlike <tt>WO</tt> mode, a file is
      not truncated when you open it.
</dl>
