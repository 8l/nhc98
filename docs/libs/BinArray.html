<center><h1>Using the NHC.BinArray library</h1></center>

<hr>
This document describes the York BinArray library, a library for
imperative binary arrays which, although it is implemented using the
<a href="Binary.html">Binary</a> library, has an independent interface and
can be used pretty-much without any knowledge of the Binary library at
all.  We present this BinArray module as an example of the use of the
Binary library to build higher-level facilities, and would encourage
programmers to write and publish other useful libraries in a similar
manner.

<h3><a name=binarray>NHC.BinArray library</a></h3>
<p>
<pre>
    module NHC.BinArray 
      ( type  BinArray
      , newBinArray
      , intoBinArray
      , fromBinArray
      , putBinArray
      , getBinArray
      ) where

    data BinArray a = ...

    newBinArray   :: Binary a =&gt; Int -&gt; a -&gt; IO (BinArray a)

    intoBinArray  :: Binary a =&gt; BinArray a -&gt; a   -&gt; IO Int
    fromBinArray  :: Binary a =&gt; BinArray a -&gt; Int -&gt; IO a

    putBinArray   :: Binary a =&gt; FilePath -&gt; BinArray a -&gt; IO ()
    getBinArray   :: Binary a =&gt; FilePath -&gt; IO (BinArray a)
</pre>

<p>
A <tt>BinArray a</tt> is an imperative (mutable) array that holds values
of type <tt>a</tt> in binary representation.  It is implemented using
the Binary library, but as you can see, this is largely hidden from
the programmer.  A BinArray can only be written to sequentially.  If one
attempts to read a value from an index position which has not yet been
written to (or which is beyond the bounds of the array), a default value
is returned.
<p>
A BinArray can be stored in a file between program runs.  Reading and
writing BinArrays to disk is fast.  Once a BinArray has been read back
from disk, it can be written to again in the usual way.

<table><tr>
  <td><tt>newBinArray n d</tt></td>
  <td>gives you a fresh binary array of size <tt>n</tt>,
      filled with default value <tt>d</tt>.  The binary values are
      stored in memory.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><tt>intoBinArray ba x</tt></td>
  <td>stuffs the value <tt>x</tt> into the array <tt>ba</tt>
      using a binary representation</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><tt>fromBinArray ba i</tt></td>
  <td>gives you back the value at the <tt>i</tt>'th
      position in the array <tt>ba</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><tt>putBinArray fn ba</tt></td>
  <td>copies the whole array <tt>ba</tt> into a binary file whose name is
      <tt>fn</tt></td>
</tr><tr>
  <td><tt>getBinArray fn</tt></td>
  <td>gives you back a binary array read from the file named <tt>fn</tt></td>

</tr></table>
