<h1>Known bugs in <em>hmake</em></h1>
</center>
<hr>

<ul>

<li> <font color="red">(Fixed in 3.11)</font>
     If an <em>import</em> statement has a leading open-brace on the same
     line, due to explicit layout, it will not be recognised.

<li> <font color="red">(Fixed in 3.10)</font>
     If several <em>import</em> statements occur on the same line of
     a source file (separated by semicolons), then hmake will only
     recognise the first import on the line as a dependency.

<li> <font color="red">(Fixed in 3.10)</font>
     A Happy grammar (.y or .ly file) with a non-terminal
     name <em>import</em> confuses hmake, which reports that
     a <em>module ::</em> cannot be found.

<li> Conflicting compiler options (e.g. both -fsomething and
     -fno-something for ghc) may (rarely) be re-ordered by hmake,
     such that the compiler treats the conflict in the opposite way to
     your intention.  The exact circumstances in which any re-ordering
     happens are not currently pinned down.

<li> <font color="red">Fixed in 3.09.</font>
     Complex CPP #ifs involving chains of boolean operators, with or
     without parentheses, are occasionally parsed at the wrong
     precedence.  Also, CPP line continuations are currently ignored.
     Both of these problems will be fixed in the next release.
