<p>
<em>Hmake-config</em> is a small utility for managing your <em>hmake</em>
compiler database.  It can show a summary of which compilers are known,
or it can update the database (held in an <em>hmakerc</em> file)
by adding or deleting knowledge about a particular Haskell compiler,
or changing the default compiler.

<h3><a name="usage">Usage</a></h3>
<p>
The basic option summary is:
<pre>
    Usage: hmake-config [cfgfile] new
           hmake-config [cfgfile] list [compiler]
           hmake-config [cfgfile] [add|delete|default] compiler
</pre>
The optional <em>cfgfile</em> is your chosen location of the database
of known compilers, should you happen not to wish to use the default
locations.  (See section <a href="#database">About the compiler
database</a> below.)


<h3><a name="view">Viewing the compiler database</a></h3>
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 width=400><tr>
<td><b>list</b><br></td>
	<td>A summary of all compilers known by <em>hmake</em> is listed, one
	 compiler per line.  The default compiler is also reported.
        </td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>list</b>&nbsp;<em>comp</em><br></td>
	<td>Full details for the compiler <em>comp</em> are shown.
        </td>
</tr></table>
</center>
<p>
For instance:
<pre>
    $ <em>hmake-config list</em>
    Global config file is:
        /usr/local/lib/hmake/ix86-Linux/hmakerc
    Personal config file is:
        ~/.hmakerc/ix86-Linux
    Known compilers:
        nhc98	(v1.14)
        hbc	(0.9999.5b,)
        ghc-4.08.2	(4.08.2)
        ghc-5.02.3	(5.02.3)
        ghc	(5.02.3)
        /usr/local/bin/nhc98	(v1.14)
        /usr/local/bin/hbc	(0.9999.5b,)
        /usr/local/bin/ghc	(5.04.2)
    Default compiler:
        nhc98

    $ <em>hmake-config list /usr/local/bin/ghc</em>
    CompilerConfig
      { compilerStyle = ghc
      , compilerPath = "/usr/local/bin/ghc"
      , compilerVersion = "5.04.2"
      , includePaths = ["/usr/local/lib/ghc-5.04.2/imports/base"
                       ,"/usr/local/lib/ghc-5.04.2/imports/haskell98"
                       ]
      , cppSymbols = ["__GLASGOW_HASKELL__=504"]
      , extraCompilerFlags = []
      , isHaskell98 = True
      }
</pre>


<p>
<h3><a name="update">Updating the compiler database</a></h3>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> the very first time you use <em>hmake-config</em>
to update the compiler database, you must create your own personal
config, using the <em>new</em> option (see details in the table below).

<p>
To update your compiler database, one of the actions <em>add</em>,
<em>delete</em>, or <em>default</em> is applied to the
<em>compiler</em> given on the commandline.  (If no action is given,
<em>add</em> is assumed.)  The <em>compiler</em> can be specified
either as a simple name which resolves to an executable command name
via the normal <tt>$PATH</tt> mechanism, or as an absolute pathname
to the compiler (these are treated as different database entries), e.g.

<pre>
    $ hmake-config add ghc		# takes the first ghc in the $PATH
    $ hmake-config add /usr/bin/ghc	# takes a specific version
</pre>

<center>
<table border=1 width=400><tr>
<td><b>new</b></td>
	<td>Start a completely fresh hmakerc configuration file.  If
            the file already existed, it is overwritten.  (If no hmakerc
            file was explicitly specified, the default "personal" location
            within your home directory is assumed.)
            </td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>add</b>&nbsp;<em>comp</em><br></td>
	<td>The specified compiler is probed for various pieces of
            information, including its version, and the paths to
            directories holding interface files for standard libraries.
            If everything is OK, that compiler's configuration is added
            to the hmakerc file, or if it was already known, the
            configuration is updated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>add-dyn</b>&nbsp;<em>comp</em><br></td>
	<td>The specified compiler is added to the hmakerc file, but
            it is probed for its version/interface information dynamically
            every time it is used, instead of only once statically right now.
            This option is especially useful if you frequently change
            the compiler that appears first in your PATH variable and don't
            want to be bothered to have to tell hmake about those changes
            every time.
	</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>delete</b>&nbsp;<em>comp</em></td>
	<td>All configuration information for the specified compiler is
            removed from the hmakerc file.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><b>default</b>&nbsp;<em>comp</em></td>
	<td>Provided the specified compiler is already known in the
            hmakerc file, it is made the default compiler.  If it is not
            known, the default remains unchanged and an error is reported.
            </td>

<h3><a name="database">About the compiler database</a></h3>
<p>
The <em>hmakerc</em> file manipulated by <em>hmake-config</em> is
written in plain text, as a structured Haskell value.  You are free
to read it, and edit it by hand if you wish.  (Be aware however that
a later use of <em>hmake-config add</em> may override any changes
you make.)

<p>
In fact, there are potentially two <em>hmakerc</em> files that might
be involved in any transaction with <em>hmake-config</em>.  Firstly,
there is the "global" config file, normally created at the time
<em>hmake</em> is installed: it resides in the system directories
(usually at <tt>/usr/local/lib/hmake/$MACHINE/hmakerc</tt>), and cannot
be changed except by the system administrator.  Then, there may be a
"personal" config file, residing in the user's home directory (always
at <tt>$HOME/.hmakerc/$MACHINE</tt>): it permits an individual to
override (point-wise) the system-wide configuration, for instance,
if a different version of a compiler comes earlier in the user's PATH,
or if the user prefers a different default compiler.

<p>
When an <em>hmake-config</em> command-line does not name a specific
hmakerc file, it reads both the global and the personal files,
but writes only to the personal file.

<p>
When an <em>hmake-config</em> command-line explicitly names an hmakerc
file, the named file is used for all reading and writing, instead of
the "global" and the "personal" files.  (The command <em>new</em> must
be used to initialise the file before it can be used.)  Remember that
if you use a non-standard location for your named hmakerc file,
you will also need to tell <em>hmake</em> proper where it is on
every invocation.


<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
To support users who may have access to heterogeneous machines on a
network with a shared filespace, there is a separate <em>hmakerc</em>
file for each machine architecture they use.  This is very important to
avoid conflicts between versions of compilers.  (In the description
above, <tt>$MACHINE</tt> represents the machine architecture as
reported by <tt>`harch`</tt>, not the actual machine name.)

<p>
It is difficult to detect the exact directories in which
<em>hbc</em> expects to find interface files for standard libraries.
Thus <em>hmake-config</em> relies on the environment variables
<tt>HBCDIR</tt> or <tt>LMLDIR</tt> for the correct location.

<p>
When the system administrator wishes to update the global config file,
it is sufficient just to name it explicitly in an <em>hmake-config</em>
command, assuming the file permissions are set appropriately.
