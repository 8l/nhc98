<h3>What is hmake?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>hmake</em> is a compilation manager for Haskell programs.
    See <a href="hmake.html">hmake.html</a> for more details.
<li><em>hmake interactive</em>, or <em>hi</em> for short, is an interactive
    program development environment for Haskell, rather like <em>Hugs</em>.
    See <a href="interactive.html">interactive.html</a> for more details.
<li><em>hmake-config</em> is an auxiliary tool for managing the set
    of compilers known by <em>hmake</em>, useful when you install a
    new compiler, or a new version of a compiler.
    See <a href="hmake-config.html">hmake-config.html</a> for more details.
<li><em>runhs</em> is a <tt>#!</tt> script 'interpreter' for Haskell, using
    hmake underneath to build and run the program script.
    See <a href="runhs.html">runhs.html</a> for more details.
</ul>

<p>
If you're running the unstable version of Debian GNU/Linux system, you
can download and install hmake with a command like <tt>apt-get install
hmake</tt>, or download the package file from:
  <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/h/hmake/">
  <tt>http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/h/hmake/</tt></a>
(The package is not yet available for the stable version of Debian.)

<p>
(Note: If you have the <em>nhc98</em> compiler, then you already
have some version of <em>hmake</em>.  However, if you installed another
compiler after <em>nhc98</em>, you will probably need to run <a
href="hmake-config.html">hmake-config</a> to add the new compiler to
<em>hmake</em>'s database.  Also, it is perfectly safe to download a
newer version of <em>hmake</em> and install it on top of the version
that came with <em>nhc98</em>.)

<h3><a name="install">Configure, compile, and install</a></h3>
<p>
<pre>
  $ ./configure  --prefix=/my/installation
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>

<p>
Use
<pre>
  $ configure --help
</pre>
to discover what options you can change at configuration time.  The
configuration process actually does quite a good job of detecting what
Haskell compilers you have, where they live, and anything special they
might need.  However, should you need to change anything by hand, after
installation, use the <a href="hmake-config.html"><em>hmake-config</em></a>
utility.

<p>
<b>Notes</b>
<p>
`harch' is a little script for determining your processor/OS
combination.  It is supplied because many sites have heterogeneous
networks of machines all accessing a common filespace.  You only need to
install one copy of the `hmake' script, which uses `harch' to select the
correct executables for any particular machine.

<p>
For <em>hi</em> to work on the Windows/Cygwin platform, you must
export the SHELL environment variable before starting the interpreter.

<p>
The system-wide hmakerc configuration file lives in:
<pre>
    /usr/local/lib/hmake/$MACHINE/hmakerc
</pre>
(Of course, you don't have to use the root location /usr/local for
your installation.  Just use --prefix= at configuration time to
reflect your preference.)

<p>
A personal hmakerc configuration file can live in:
<pre>
    $HOME/.hmakerc/$MACHINE
</pre>
Normally, a user will simply use the system-wide hmakerc.  If you
want to make any customisations, for instance to add a new compiler
or change the default, you first need to create a personal hmakerc
file with <em>hmake-config new</em>.  Only the person who installs
hmake can change the system-wide hmakerc.
