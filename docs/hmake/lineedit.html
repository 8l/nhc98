<center><h1>The <em>hmake interactive</em> line editor</h1></center>

<hr>
<p>
<em>Hmake interactive</em> allows you to type expressions at the
commandline, one expression per line.  If you have a long expression,
you are likely to make a mistake somewhere.  Hence, we include a
simple line editor to allow you to correct mistakes before pressing
the <tt>return</tt> key.

<p>
Provided you have <em>readline</em> available on your system, and you
build <em>hi</em> with <em>ghc</em>, you will get all the readline
functionality built in to <em>hi</em> automatically.

<p>
However, if you don't have <em>readline</em>, or you didn't build with
<em>ghc</em>, you get a very basic line editor instead.  This line
editor does <b>not</b> provide the full functionality you would expect
from the <em>readline</em> library, but is provided on the grounds
that some basic editing is better than none at all.  (And of course,
it is written fully in Haskell'98.  Hence, do feel free to change or
add your own preferred keystrokes for editing.)  Since hmake-3.08,
the line editor <em>does</em> have a history mechanism for retrieving
earlier expressions or commands.



<h3>Editing Keystrokes</h3>
<p>
A word of warning: the keystrokes noted in this table seem to be
somewhat dependent on the terminal settings of the environment in
which you run <em>hi</em>.  You might need to experiment a little
to discover what works on your machine.
