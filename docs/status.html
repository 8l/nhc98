<p>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.22 (2010-07-09) features</h3>

<li> Bugfix:  Now builds on 64-bit machines (in 32-bit mode)
<li> Bugfix:  Newer version of hmake (3.13)
<li> Bugfix:  The evil mangler is now less evil (and more robust)
<li> Bugfix:  Add a workaround for the hi-membug that caused build failures
              on many recent Linux platforms.

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.18 (2005-03-11) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	Several more packages of hierarchical libraries are included in
		the build: base, parsec, haskell-src, QuickCheck, HaXml,
		HUnit, Cabal.
<li> New:	FFI improvements: foreign import "dynamic" is now supported,
		and named C header-files are now used.
<li> New:	The compiler now uses cpphs for Haskell source instead of cpp.
		This removes problems with string gaps, primes in identifiers,
		and so on.
<li> New:	In hmake-interactive, if the readline library is not available,
		the simple line editor now has a history mechanism.
<li> Bugfix:	hmake's processing of cpp conditional directives is improved
		also.
<li> Bugfix:	Evil bugfixes for ghc versions &ge; 6.0
<li> Bugfix:	More evil bugfixes for gcc versions &ge; 3.3
<li> Bugfix:	A numeric pattern can now match against a Num newtype.
<li> Bugfix:	Foreign imports and abstract newtypes now play OK together.
<li> Bugfix:	Methods in qualified classes no longer need to be qualified
		in instance decls.
<li> Bugfix:	GreenCard now accepts &lt;&lt;.../...&gt;&gt; syntax.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous internal tidy-ups, including fixes such that nhc98
		can once again be built by hbc.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.16 (2003-03-08) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	A large subset of the <em>base</em> package of
		hierarchical libraries is now included in the build.
<li> New:	The primitive FFI mechanism has been updated to match
		the latest official spec, and the full Foreign
		libraries are also included (in hierarchical form).
<li> Performance: The library function List.sortBy now uses a stable
		O(n log n) mergesort.
<li> Bugfix:	nhc98 now works correctly in the presence of gcc-3.x.
<li> Bugfix:	nhc98 once again builds on Cygwin with ghc.
<li> Bugfix:	Numerous other small fixes, including revisions to the
		Haskell'98 standard.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.14a (2002-08-13) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> The only change between 1.14 and 1.14a is that the version of
     hmake included in the source package has been updated from 3.05
     to 3.06.
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>nhc98 1.14 (2002-06-14) features</h3>
<ul>
<li> New:	The Hat tracing system is now entirely separate from
		the nhc98 compiler.  Hat can now be used with either ghc
		or nhc98 - you should download and build the Hat system
		<em>after</em> building nhc98.
<li> New:	The compiler now supports a simplified version of ghc's
		package mechanism.  No documentation yet, but Hat relies
		on it.
<li> Performance: Various patches for improved time/space usage of the
		compiler itself, contributed by Thomas Nordin.
<li> Bugfix:	Various small fixes for OS environments like OpenBSD,
		ix86-Solaris, etc.
</ul>

<h3>Status of various components</h3>

<p>
The basic, stable, components include the compiler itself, the Standard
Prelude and Libraries, heap profiling facilities, and the tools hmake,
greencard, and hp2graph.  Relatively recent additions to the system
are the time profiler and common FFI.
