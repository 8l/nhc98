<center><h1>nhc98 compliance with Haskell 98</h1></center>

<hr>

<p>
<b>nhc98</b> is pretty close to being compliant with the Haskell
98 standard.  Here is a complete list of the known deficiencies in
<em>nhc98</em>.  (See also our list of <a href="limits.html">size
limitations</a>.)

<ul>
<li> A very small number of the Standard Library functions remain
     unimplemented.  (Runtime warnings are provided for all
     unimplemented functions.)  The main functions currently missing
     are those which manipulate TimeDiffs in the Time Library, and
     a few of the more obscure IO library functions.

<li> The simple context restriction has not yet been removed.

<li> The declaration style <tt> funlhs -&gt; ( funlhs ) {apat} </tt>
     is not implemented.

<li> The monomorphism restriction is not implemented.

<li> Although the Unicode character set is used internally, there are
     no facilities for reading or writing files with characters
     represented by more than 8-bits.  Large chars currently appear
     only as numeric escape codes.

</ul>

<p>
If you would like to implement any of these libraries or features, your
<a href="contrib.html">contribution</a> would be most welcome.

<p>
In addition, the following Haskell'98 behaviours are normally turned off.
Use the <tt>-98</tt> flag to turn them all on, or use the equivalent
separate flags.

<ul>
<li> <tt>(n+k)</tt> patterns are normally switched off.  Use <em>-nkpat</em>
     to switch them on.

<li> Underscore is not normally treated as a lower-case letter.  In
     fact, it is usually transparent: the name <tt>_f</tt> is a varid,
     but the name <tt>_F</tt> is a conid because it begins with an
     uppercase letter (i.e. after the underscore).  Use <em>-underscore</em>
     to treat underscores as strictly lower-case.


</ul>
