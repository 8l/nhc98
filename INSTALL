The short version is:

  $ ./configure   [ --prefix=/my/installation ]
  $ make
  $ make install

which provides you with the basic and tracing versions of the
nhc98 compiler in /usr/local, [or in /my/installation if you used
the --prefix= option].  If you want slightly more control, try

  $ make help

which will give you a list of other build targets.  The 'default'
target gives you the standard compiler/libraries ('basic') plus the
tracing variant and browsing tools ('tracer').  'make all' gives you,
in addition,  heap profiling and time profiling variants.

System requirements:

The build requires GNU make and a C compiler (usually gcc) with a 32-bit
compatibility mode, together with the usual tools of the UNIX
environment, such as sh, ar, sed, etc.  A java compiler is required to
build the debugging browser 'hood'.  (If you don't have java, don't
worry - the build will stop with an error, but everything else you need
has already been built.)
