If you have just got hold of a copy of the darcs repository, you will
need to run "sh start" before proceeding.

A lot of useful information is in the docs directory, all in html format.
This includes configuration, installation, and usage instructions.

Start by pointing your web browser at the file
    docs/index.html

Updates to the documentation and new releases of the software are
available from

    http://www.haskell.org/nhc98/
    http://www.haskell.org/hmake/
and also at
